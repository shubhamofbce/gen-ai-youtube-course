## 📘 Course Modules

### **Module 1: OpenAI API Fundamentals**
Learn the basics of using the OpenAI platform, APIs, and capabilities.

- Introduction to OpenAI and its model ecosystem (GPT, DALL·E, Whisper)
- Creating projects, setting budgets, and generating API keys
- Using the Playground to experiment with models
- Generating text, images, and audio
- Prototyping real-world apps like a social media post generator
- Understanding pricing, tokens, and parameters like temperature, top_p, etc.

---

### **Module 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Manual First**
Understand and build RAG systems from scratch.

- Why RAG is needed: hallucinations, context limitations
- Chunking, embeddings, similarity search (with OpenAI API)
- Vector DBs like FAISS and ChromaDB
- Manually building a RAG pipeline: Embed → Search → Retrieve → Answer
- Transitioning to LangChain: building same pipeline with framework
- Handling multi-doc inputs and improving RAG quality

---

### **Module 3: AI Agents (Manual & Frameworks)**
Go beyond chatbots. Build autonomous, reasoning-based agents.

- AI Agents vs Traditional Chatbots
- Function calling and structured output
- Research agents: Google search + summarization
- Manual orchestration of tools
- Using LangChain and Autogen for AgentExecutor, memory, tools, and chaining

---

### **Module 4: RAG Evaluation Using RAGAS**
Measure the factual accuracy and relevance of your RAG systems.

- Why evaluation is critical in Gen AI systems
- Introduction to RAGAS metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness, context precision
- Setup and format of RAGAS inputs and outputs
- Improving system performance based on evaluation feedback

---

### **Module 5: Fine-Tuning OpenAI Models**
When and how to fine-tune base models.

- Deciding when fine-tuning is the right approach
- Preparing datasets in JSONL format
- Best practices for collecting and formatting prompt-completion pairs
- Uploading data and initiating fine-tune jobs

---

### **Module 6: Production Considerations**
Get ready to ship your Gen AI app.
